backend image saving
move the project to nextjs
have your own route for saving images
then it's a question where to host, vercel does server side storage now?
but if not spin up EC2 - there will be a way to work it out
and nextjs is a good next step.

clean nextjs project



## Setup

depends on a hacky way of getting images in and out of the code by setting a symlink to Downloads
myDownloads -> /Users/paulabbott/Downloads/

i want to reach out to fram but also feel i need something that i can give her to play with
and i need to get to that point anyway. so while I think about reaching out lets at least write some more code.

I've got erodes working automaticly but with downloading the images
I'd like to maybe do that processing by storing the data rather than canvas swapping
because that would get closer to a online tool

but there is a sense that i should just go with what works to see what needs to be done, I am sketching here not building.

so if i stick with the download symlink strategy what would I do next?

Wish list
- one button create-comps
why don't I do this, it's a small step but it's where I want to get to

- bigger images
the main problem with this is generating the bigger images, I could just use numbers, or just faces? that might be intresting.

- multi channel
- stop using download symlink method
- process image data internally
- choose and order image interface
- fine image placement
- live preview

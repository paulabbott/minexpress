            hello so I can upload an image using am ajax request and it gets save on the server. but that's not quite what i need 
because what do i post as the image data, unless I can set a type of the upload and a path, but I don't have a path 
because I've generated this image. so I probably am going to have to call .toDataUrl() or ctx.getImageData()

some people say just post the imagedata to the server, and then convert it there, or I guess I could just read it back 
from there and draw it onto a canvas. that sounds like a better route than trying to 

ah there is also a server side implmentation of canvas, so I could convert the data to an image.

or I could just download the whole lot and copy and paste the files to where I need them. or even read them out of 
the downloads folder? I know it's messy but it's not production code and it is PoC - the crap solution might be the 
smart thing to do here.

so if we were going to do the fastest thing possiable.
download the images with good file names. copy them back into the folder
then write something that we scroll threw them which I need to write anyway and will give me a better idea of what the real thing 
would be like than some neat code which saves them to the right place to begin with. Happy to have a route to get there but not
worth going in that direction atm.
